# cnet
Cnet is a lightweight, header-only framework to train and use Convolutional Neural Networks and MLPs. See examples/examples.cpp on how to use it.

Currently, the framework supports the following layer types:

    - Conv2D
    - Conv2DTranspose
    - FullyConnected
    - CropAndConcat
    - MaxPool2D

Training can be performed in parallel on CPU.
